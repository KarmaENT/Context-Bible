* **Blueprint ID:** Website_About_Page_v1
* **Objective:** To tell the story of the company or individual, building trust and connection with the visitor.
* **Structure:**
  * **Headline:** More than just "About Us." It should be a compelling statement of the company's mission or belief (e.g., "We're Here to Help You Build the Future").
  * **The Problem (The "Why We Exist"):**
    * Start by describing the problem you set out to solve. This shows empathy for the visitor's struggles.
  * **The Solution (The "How We Solved It"):**
    * Tell the story of how the company was founded or the product was created. Make it a narrative.
  * **The Mission/Vision:**
    * A clear and concise statement of the company's purpose and long-term goals.
  * **Meet the Team (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Photos and brief bios of key team members. This humanizes the brand.
  * **The Call to Action (CTA):**
    * What do you want the visitor to do next? (e.g., "See Our Work," "Contact Us," "Join Our Team").
* **Formatting Rules:** Use authentic, high-quality photos of the team, not stock photos. Write in a genuine, human voice. Break up large blocks of text with subheadings and images.
