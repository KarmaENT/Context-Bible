* **Blueprint ID:** Sales_Email_Cold_Outreach_v1
* **Objective:** To get a cold prospect to agree to a brief meeting or call.
* **Structure:**
  * **Subject Line:** Personalized and intriguing, not salesy (e.g., "Question about [Prospect's Company]" or "[Referral Name] suggested I reach out").
  * **Opening Line (The "Why You?"):**
    * A genuine, specific compliment about their work, a recent company announcement, or a shared connection. This proves it's not a mass email.
  * **The Problem & Value Prop (The "What's In It For Me?"):**
    * A single sentence that identifies a likely pain point for their role/industry.
    * A single sentence that states your value proposition as it relates to that pain point. (e.g., "I help companies like yours solve [Problem] by doing [Solution]").
  * **The Call to Action (CTA):**
    * A low-friction, specific request. Avoid "Do you have time for a demo?".
    * Instead, use an interest-based CTA: "Would you be open to learning more about how we helped [Similar Company] achieve [Result]?"
  * **Signature:**
    * Your Name
    * Title
    * Company
    * Link to your LinkedIn profile or website.
* **Formatting Rules:** Keep the entire email under 100 words. Write in plain text, not HTML. Do not include images or attachments. The tone should be professional but human.
