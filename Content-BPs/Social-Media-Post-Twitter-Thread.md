* **Blueprint ID:** Social_Media_Post_Twitter_Thread_v1
* **Objective:** To share a valuable insight or story in a series of tweets, designed to be engaging and shareable.
* **Structure:**
  * **Tweet 1 (The Hook):** A strong, attention-grabbing opening that makes a bold claim or asks a provocative question.
  * **Tweets 2-5 (The Body):** A series of tweets that expand on the hook, providing evidence, examples, or a step-by-step narrative.
  * **Tweet 6 (The Climax/Takeaway):** The main point or conclusion of the thread.
  * **Tweet 7 (The Call to Action):** A final tweet that encourages engagement (e.g., "What are your thoughts?," "Share this if you found it helpful") or drives traffic to a link.
* **Formatting Rules:** Keep each tweet focused on a single idea. Use line breaks to make tweets easy to read. Use emojis to add personality. Use a "thread" indicator (e.g., "1/7," "THREAD") to let readers know it's a series.
