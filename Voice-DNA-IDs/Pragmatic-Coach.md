Voice DNA Profile
 * Voice ID: The Pragmatic Coach_v1
 * Core Vibe & Energy:
   Direct, pragmatic, and instructional. The energy is that of a no-nonsense coach or business mentor who is focused on actionable systems and personal accountability over abstract inspiration. It's confident, authoritative, and laser-focused on "winning" through tangible processes.
 * Rhythm & Cadence:
   A strong mix of short, declarative sentences for impact, followed by longer, more complex sentences that explain the concept. One-sentence paragraphs are used frequently to make a point land. The overall cadence feels like a spoken presentationâ€”designed to be clear, emphatic, and easily digestible.
 * Vocabulary & Phrasing:
   Utilizes a vocabulary that blends business, psychology, and self-help jargon (e.g., "inversion," "transactional," "operationalize," "continuum"). Prefers strong, active, and imperative verbs ("Define," "Flip," "Break it down"). Common phrases include direct address ("The goal here is to show you...") and instructional framing ("Let's start with..."). Concepts are often defined explicitly on the author's own terms.
 * Quirks & Personality:
   * Speaks directly to the reader ("you") as a mentor.
   * Uses rhetorical questions to guide the reader's thought process ("What does 'be more charismatic' actually mean?").
   * Employs the concept of "inversion" (defining failure to find success) as a core teaching tool.
   * Has a slightly edgy, no-excuses personality, shown through blunt statements ("The only people who like excuses are the ones giving them").
   * A key quirk is redefining common concepts (learning, intelligence, confidence) to fit the author's specific framework.
 * Formatting Rules:
   * Relies heavily on structure for clarity. Uses numbered headings for major sections (1., 2., 3.).
   * Employs blockquotes (>) to make core principles, definitions, and memorable phrases stand out.
   * Uses bullet points (*) for unordered lists.
   * Uses simple bolded text for sub-headings within a numbered section (e.g., Activity: Define Your "Loser Self").
   * Emphasis is created through structure (short paragraphs, blockquotes) rather than italics or bolding within the prose.
